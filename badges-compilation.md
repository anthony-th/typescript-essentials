## Reflections 😓📓

1️⃣ **Getting Started with TypeScript**: 📓 In this section, I gained a general understanding of TypeScript, learned about installing necessary software and dependencies essential for any TypeScript work, extensively studied basic project configurations for TypeScript work, and the compilation of any JavaScript project into TypeScript. ✅

2️⃣ **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: 📓  In this section, I learned about variable declarations using primitive types, object types, and union and intersection types in TypeScript. I also learned to explain the advantages of declaring typed variables. ✅

3️⃣  **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: 📓 This section taught me interface declaration, creating its instances, extending interfaces, declaring interfaces with custom array types, and practical usage of interfaces. ✅

4️⃣ **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**: 📓 This section taught me to create functions with strictly typed parameters and return values, explained the creation of optional parameters, rest parameters, and default parameters; learned to define function types and their usage in TypeScript. ✅

5️⃣  **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**: 📓 This section taught me to use classes in TypeScript to describe object shapes, declare classes, create class instances, apply access modifiers to a class, define properties in a class, declare a class that extends another class, and declare an interface to specify the shape of a class. ✅

6️⃣ **Generics in TypeScript**: 📓 Thanks to this section, I learned and practiced applying generic templates. They provide a way to specify to functions, classes, or interfaces what type you want to use when calling them and are currently not available in JavaScript. ✅

7️⃣ **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**: 📓 This section helped me understand how to use external type libraries and organize code using modules. ✅

8️⃣ **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**: 📓 This module explained to me how to organize code using namespaces: it discussed the purpose of namespaces, their types, and the usage of namespaces and modules in design. ✅
